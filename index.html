                <p class="editable">
                A life coach is a professional who helps individuals identify and achieve their personal and professional goals. Life coaching is a thought provoking, creative, and collaborative process where a certified coach works with a client to assess their current situation, explore their desires and aspirations, and develop strategies and action plans to achieve their goals. 
                Sara coaches clients seeking a greater sense of joy in various areas of life, including career, relationships, health, personal growth, and overall well-being. She helps clients develop self-awareness, enhance their strengths, improve their mindset, and take practical steps towards achieving their goals, with joy! </p>
                <p class="editable">
                Life coaches do not provide therapy or counseling, but rather focus on helping clients set and achieve goals in the present and future. Sara believes that individuals have the potential to create positive change in their lives, and that she, as a skilled coach, can facilitate that process by providing guidance, support, and motivation. Sara's coaching sessions can be conducted through one-on-one sessions via phone or Zoom sessions. The duration of coaching engagement can vary depending on the goals and needs of the client.

                <p class="editable">Sara Schneider is a passionate creative from the quaint Minnesota lake town, Prior Lake. As a photographer, joy-seeker, and chaser of sunsets, Sara's passion for celebrating and capturing life's moments have led to connections that are formed in joy, commitment, and meaningful conversations. </p>
                <p class="editable">Sara and her husband Mike have four wonderful children! Their journey together through infertility, failed adoption, successful adoptions, a surprise successful biological pregnancy, and navigating life with a highly special needs child, have taught her the power of positivity, patience, and prayer. Sara’s unrelenting pursuit of joy even in the most dismal of circumstances have led her to turn around very dark situations in favor of seeking the light–the good–the silver linings. She lives each day acknowledging the small joys and celebrating the radiant Golden Hour.</p>
                <p class="editable">Sara's natural-born optimism and unwavering Catholic faith have guided her to pursue certification through Fowler International Academy of Professional Coaching as a Certified Life Coach. This natural extension of her innate ability and desire to build relationships through connection with others, has enabled her to open her heart through listening, guiding, and encouraging others on a journey towards the light and joy they desire.</p>
                <p class="editable">Nothing brings Sara more joy than to empower others to discover their own unique talents, pursue their passions, and live a life of purpose and fulfillment. Her compassionate and encouraging approach, combined with her keen intuition and deep understanding of the human spirit, makes her a sought-after mentor and guide on the path to self-discovery and personal growth.

                <p class="editable">In photography, the Golden Hour, also known as the Magic Hour, refers to the time shortly after sunrise or before sunset when the light is soft, warm, and diffused. It occurs when the sun is near the horizon, and its low angle creates long shadows and a soft, golden light that is highly sought after by photographers for its flattering and dramatic effect on subjects and landscapes. The duration of the Golden Hour varies depending on the location, time of year, and weather conditions, but it typically lasts for about an hour or so.</p>
